## DopeWars 3.x ##
                                                                                 
**DopeWars is a *nix rewrite of a game originally based on "Drug Wars" by John E. Del in 1986. It is with great gratitude, respect and amongst other things, nostalgia that I sat down and used 3 days on creating this, so that Unix/Linux sysadm's and fanboys could re-live their youth in this thug`driven game.
                                                                                                   
And hey, it's open source and should work on almost all *nix distros since it's hacked for bash 3+ which was a real pain since it doesn't support any associative array's and such, in any functional way that is. So I hope that you enjoy the game the way it is and don`t cheat altering the initial  
parameters ;-)                                                                                     
                                                                                                   
From time to time, I create stuff that could be interesting, not only shell-games, so check out my Github page http://github.com/olect                                                                
                                                                                                   
If somethings doesn't work as expected or you have improvements, fix it and send me a pull request and I`ll be more then gladely to commit it.
